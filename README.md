This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are inconsistently applied to HTML elements. The bug is characterized by intermittent application failure of Tailwind classes, with no discernible pattern.  The `bug.html` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` offers a solution, although it may not directly address the root cause in all situations. The cause remains elusive, possibly involving complex interactions between Tailwind's configuration, browser caching, or other external factors. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact source of the error.
