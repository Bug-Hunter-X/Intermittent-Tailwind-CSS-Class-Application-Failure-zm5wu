I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, even though the classes seemed to be valid and correctly implemented. This problem manifested only in specific scenarios, making it difficult to trace.  The issue appeared intermittently, making it hard to debug consistently. For example, sometimes the `bg-red-500` class worked, while at other times it wouldn't, with no apparent reason. I inspected the generated CSS and the HTML source code to verify the classes were there and were not being overridden but couldn't find any explanation.
